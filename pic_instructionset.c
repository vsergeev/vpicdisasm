#include "pic_disasm.h"

/* I decided to have the operand masks and types here in the
 * main instruction set data structure of the disassembler for clean
 * opcode recognition and operand extraction. It's much more straight
 * forward to work with numbers then manipulating ugly operand
 * strings such as "000011rdddddrrrr" for the add instruction. */
/* This was my first disassembler, and my program ended evolving with this
 * data structure. Turns out it makes code pretty clear, and it generalizes the
 * entire disassembly process, but development probably took about 2x longer
 * instead of hard coding the disassembly for different types of operands. */
/* But this disassembler model can be applied to virtually any 16-bit
 * or less opcode architecture, making it very flexible in nature--I don't
 * have to rewrite all of the operand disassembly code for interpreting
 * different r, d, K, k, s, etc. characters in the opcode, which all stand
 * for a different operand type, because they are written out
 * in the instruction set data structure.
